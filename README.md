To install the packages I expect to use during this workshop with mini/Anaconda:

    conda install -c conda-forge biopython emcee numpy jupyter scipy matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn mdtraj pyemma itertools

**Workshop 1:** Python list review, NumPy intro, basic plotting with matplotlib, nonlinear curve fitting with scipy, and Bayesian inference for nonlinear least squares, using pulse proteolysis data as an example. (several sessions)

**Workshop 2:** Retrieving and parsing data from the Protein Data Bank using biopython's PDB module.

**Workshop 3-?:** Working with sequence data and alignments using biopython, basic image analysis with scikit-image using single-molecule TIRF data as an example, working with molecular dynamics trajectories using mdtraj, analyzing saturation mutagenesis data?
